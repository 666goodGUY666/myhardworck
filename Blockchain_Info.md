# Blockchain Information

## Overview
Blockchains are decentralized, distributed ledgers that record transactions across a network of computers. They utilize cryptographic techniques to secure and validate transactions, providing transparency and immutability. Here, we aim to provide information and resources related to various blockchain platforms and their development.

## What is BlockDB?
